# Arcade Classics - Remixed
Re-makes of classic arcade games, but  made worse. \
**ON HOLD - until budgeting app is completed**

## [Dong](dong/)
Pong, but shitty. \
Ball direction and speed is randomized with each bounce, with the goal being to get the ball _through_ **your** paddle!\
    - Back-end almost completely finished
    - Graphics, framerate, etc. might be a bit too difficult as a first project, will complete Trick-Tac-Toe first. 

## [Trick-Tac-Toe](trick_tac_toe/)
Tic-Tac-Toe, but shitty. \
The goal is the same as the classic, except you don't know if you're getting an "X" or an "O" whenever you make your selection!\
