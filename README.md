Where abandoned projects go to die

## Projects

- [Arcade Classics Remixed](/arcade_classics_remixed/): A collection of classic arcade games, but made shitty. "Trick-Tac-Toe" has been revived into its own project.
- [Beard Fidget Monitor](/beard_fidget_monitor/): Raspberry Pi based machine vision project meant to alert me when I'm fidgeting with my beard. It's since been trimmed down so this project is unfortunately irrelevant.
- [Budgee](/budgee/): Elixir + Phoenix based budgeting app. This just never took off.
- [Ice Box](/ice_box/): Elixir + Phoenix based inventory app. The intent was to build this out as an all-in-one restaurant inventory management solution, but significantly better options exist on the market.
- [Perf Portal](/perf_portal/): Proof of Concept for D3.js.
- [Permission Demo](/permission_demo/): Anonymized "show and tell" project for an interview.
- [Wrazzle](/wrazzle/) Elixir + Phoenix based Scrabble clone. Lost interest.
